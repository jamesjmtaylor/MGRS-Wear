# MGRS Wear

This is an Android Wear watch app that displays your current position using the Military Grid Reference System.  The idea is that you generally only wear one watch (unless you want to look like a crazy person).  That meant that in the Army you have to choose between an Android Wear device and the Garmin Foretrex wrist GPS.  This application allows you to have the best of both worlds
